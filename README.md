# CS126_Portfolio
This is my first year CS portfolio.

I. INTRODUCTION

This portfolio is about the implementation of the various new things that we have learned in semester 2 such as the use of an array, STL concept, file manipulation, classes, and objects to make the “Searching Function”.
This so-called searching function is going to operate by inputting a barcode id of a specific product and getting a display of information about that specific product.
Alongside that we also have file maintenance or menu for short which includes search, add, edit, delete, view, check, and bin which will be explained in depth as we go on. 

II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION 

As stated, this is a project that we created using C++ coding to make a function for searching information so in this case, we have decided to act as if the searching is created for a supermarket to store information so this way by inputting the barcode id, we can get all the product’s information and price with the shown information being name, brand, category, price, country of manufacture and expiration date.

Not only that, there are 7 options to choose from the moment the code is run such as:

Search Product Information!

Add Product Information!

Edit Product Information!

View All Products Information!

Check Products By Category!

Delete Product Information!

View Deleted Product Information!

and 0. EXIT!
 	
  With these options, users can choose to either search, add, edit, view, check, delete, and also to see deleted products and their information. As for the category of products, there are also a lot to choose from and in one of the options there is also an option to just view products under certain categories such as:

Beverages & Drinks

Household & Cleaning

Canned & Jarred

Fats & Oils

Beauty & Health

Condiments & Spices

Dairy & Eggs

Meats & Frozen

Snacks & Sweets

Fruits & Vegetables
     
Stationery & Books 

Other...

Our target audience/users are people that work in supermarkets, or the like that want to have something to store their product information easily and can retrieve that information through just inputting a couple of barcode id.

The advantage of our project is that by doing this, it helps us understand more of the inner workings of new things that we just learned, especially the usage of getting, putting, and seeking information from text files such as txt or csv.

There are many benefits to using this C++ program, first of all, the pro would be that it allows users to store information by adding through the terminal, to easily edit, to easily delete, and also to view accidentally or purposefully deleted products information. 

Also, not to forget that the purpose of this C++ program is to make the search function functional and it did. By inputting barcode id, users can quickly get the information of the items they want, not only that they also have the option to view all current existing product information and check that information by category if they wish to.

Of course, not everything is perfect, this program also has one, a minor one in fact but a problem nonetheless, even though the searching, the adding, the editing, and the deleting option worked perfectly, their bond to be error and one of those is that by inputting barcode id that does not exist in the database, the user will get an error message such as putting 8 when choosing one of the seven options or putting random barcode id when searching for a product’s information.

That’s aside apart from the program cannot make guesses on a similar barcode id that the user wants to put in but accidentally put the wrong one, it also is built on Visual Studio Code so the UI is not pretty enough for regular people, it is chunky and is not interesting to look at, confusing in fact that if a person is not familiar with Visual Studio Code, they would be highly confused.
